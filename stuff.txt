balz coordinates: 38.033963, -78.517397
radius 300 appears to work fine

UVA agency id = 347

ROUTE IDS:
IL = 4013700
OL = 4013698
CGS = 4013586
NL = 4013584

STOP IDs:
Alderman Rd @ AFC = 4235112
McCormick @ Lile = 4235220


design:
input location, get list of stops near location
(HARDER — dynamically figure out best route to destination?)
get arrival estimate, inputting routes and stops


consider appending "UVA" to strings that don't find any stops
